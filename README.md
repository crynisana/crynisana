# **Hi, I’m Nisa!**

I’m a **first-semester** computer science student based in Austria, currently learning the fundamentals of programming and core computer science concepts.
At this stage, my focus is on building a strong foundation through:

- Learning programming basics and problem-solving
- Understanding how software works at a fundamental level
- Practicing with small exercises, coursework, and beginner projects

This GitHub profile serves as a record of my learning journey. You’ll find early-stage projects, experiments, and code written as I continue to develop my skills over time.
I’m approaching computer science with curiosity, consistency, and a long-term mindset, aiming to steadily improve and learn best practices as I progress.
